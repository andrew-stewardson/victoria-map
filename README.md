# victoria-map

R script using ggmap to plot location of selected cefotaxime susceptible and resistant Salmonella isolates in Victoria from humans, cows and other sources. Three maps are produced: Map 1 = simple single facet point plot; Map 2 = as map 1 but facet for each sample type; Map 3 = as map 2, with point size representing number of isolates

Note: Script assumes that Jason's data file (called 'coords') is saved in csv format in following path: 'data/base'.
